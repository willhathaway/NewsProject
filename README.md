A team project completed for the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the Harvard Extension School.

The emergence of fake news, accusations of bias in mainstream media, and the variety of contradicting sources all make it very hard to come to your own conclusions about the news of the day.

This site provides a simple way to compare how different news sites cover the same story. Using a keyword search, our algorithm will retrieve 10 headlines from two news sites of the user's choice, displaying them side by side.

The content of the articles are then compared using a word cloud, which is a method of visualizing the frequency of different words within a text.

The sites currently available for comparison are The Huffington Post, The New York Times, Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, BBC News and Al Jazeera.

Want to conduct further investigation? Well then, you can click on the article window and you will be redirected to the source.

Technologies used: Highcharts, jQuery, Firebase Authentication, News API

Thanks for checking out Cloud Compare!
